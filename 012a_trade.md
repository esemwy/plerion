# Trade : A Living Intergalactic Economy

Trade is the backbone of the galactic economy, enabling the survival and prosperity of countless planets. Hyperlane routes connect star systems, ensuring that no world remains stagnant. From industrial behemoths needing raw materials to agricultural worlds dependent on technology imports, trade fuels civilization.

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Supply and Demand**: Goods are priced based on availability and demand across the galaxy. Star systems’ wealth and development influence both the price of goods and how much each world can produce or consume.
2. **Trade Routes**: Players can exploit established routes or venture into unexplored systems to create new ones.
3. **Market Volatility**: The economy is dynamic. Political events, wars, piracy, or natural disasters can cause prices to fluctuate drastically.
4. **Factions and Influence**: Corporations, governments, and criminal organizations shape trade. Players may choose to deal with these groups—legally or otherwise.

## Establishing Trade Routes
Before engaging in trade, players must discover or chart routes between star systems. Routes are classified by their danger level and profitability. **Safe routes** have well-established infrastructure, lower risks, and stable prices. **Risky routes** through lawless or undeveloped regions offer higher potential profits but may expose traders to pirates, customs inspections, or worse.

Common trade routes exist between:
- **Agricultural Planets** (food, textiles, spirits)
- **Industrial Planets** (electronics, machinery, weapons)
- **Mining Worlds** (ores, raw materials, fuel)
- **Central Worlds** (luxuries, artifacts, high-tech products)

Players may also uncover **black markets** or smuggling opportunities, bypassing tariffs and restrictions to trade illegal goods.

## Trade Goods and Pricing

The table below provides a baseline for the average prices, suppliers, and availability of commonly traded goods across the galaxy. The **Supplier World** indicates where the good is produced, and the **Availability** column shows the typical quantity available for purchase per trade cycle.

| Goods       | Average Price | Supplier World | Availability |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Food        | 50 cr/t       | Agricultural   | 1d20x50 t    |
| Textiles    | 70 cr/t       | Agricultural   | 1d20x50 t    |
| Spirits     | 300 cr/t      | Agricultural   | 1d20x20 t    |
| Luxuries    | 900 cr/t      | Central*       | 1d20x10 t    |
| Drugs       | 50 cr/kg      | Industrial     | 1d20x20 kg   |
| Electronics | 800 cr/kg     | Industrial     | 1d20x50 kg   |
| Machinery   | 600 cr/t      | Industrial     | 1d20x50 t    |
| Alloys      | 400 cr/t      | Mining         | 1d20x40 t    |
| Weapons     | 700 cr/kg     | Industrial     | 1d20x20 kg   |
| Raws        | 120 cr/t      | Mining         | 1d20x100 t   |
| Ores        | 250 cr/t      | Mining         | 1d20x100 t   |
| Artifacts   | 50,000 ea.    | Central*       | 1d6          |
| Fuel        | 200 cr/bbl    | Any            | 1d20x10 bbl  |

\* A Central world is a Political, Religious, or Financial center.

## Supply and Demand Mechanics

Each planet has an inherent **demand** for goods based on its economy type (Agricultural, Industrial, Mining, etc.) and GDP tier (Poor, Low, Average, etc.). The higher the demand, the more they are willing to pay for goods.

### **Supply**
A planet’s production capacity is influenced by its economy type and GDP tier. Roll for available goods using the table provided, creating variability in supply.

For example:
- A Poor Agricultural planet may only export 1d20x20 tons of food, while a Rich Agricultural planet could produce 1d20x100 tons, affecting local prices accordingly.

### **Demand**
Demand is determined by a planet's economic needs, which fluctuate based on conditions. For instance:
- Agricultural planets have a **high demand** for industrial products (electronics, machinery), driving prices up.
- Industrial planets have **low demand** for food but **high demand** for raw materials and luxury items.

### Price Variations and Market Fluctuations

Prices for goods are influenced by both planetary wealth and galactic conditions. These factors work together to create a dynamic, ever-changing economy that savvy traders can exploit.

### **Planetary Wealth**
Each planet’s GDP affects the cost to purchase goods and the price at which they can be sold. Wealthier planets produce goods more efficiently and pay a premium for imports, while poorer planets struggle with higher production costs, leading to increased prices.

| Wealth Level | Purchase Price Modifier | Sale Price Modifier |
| :----------: | :---------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Poor         | +20%                    | -20%                |
| Low          | +10%                    | -10%                |
| Average      | Base Price (100%)        | Base Price (100%)   |
| Good         | -10%                    | +10%                |
| High         | -20%                    | +20%                |
| Rich         | -30%                    | +30%                |

- **Purchase Price**: When buying goods from a planet, apply the **Purchase Price Modifier** based on its wealth level.
- **Sale Price**: When selling goods, apply the **Sale Price Modifier** to determine the final sale value.

### **Market Fluctuations**

Beyond planetary wealth, prices can fluctuate due to galactic events, political conditions, or factional control. These dynamic modifiers can significantly raise or lower prices depending on the scenario.

| Condition              | Price Modifier |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| War/Conflict Zone       | +50% to +100%  |
| Famine/Drought          | +200% on Food  |
| Corporate Monopoly      | +25% to +50%   |
| Pirate Activity         | -30% to -50%   |
| Government Subsidy      | -25%           |
| Trade Sanctions         | +100% to +200% |

Events affect **both** purchase and sale prices, depending on the specific scenario.

## Calculating Final Prices

When determining the final price of goods, consider both the **Planetary Wealth Modifier** and the **Event Modifier**. Combine these factors to get the final purchase or sale price.

### **Example 1: Buying Food on a Poor Planet in a Famine**
- **Base Price of Food**: 50 cr/t
- **Poor Planet Modifier** (Purchase): +20%
- **Famine Event Modifier**: +200% on Food
- **Final Price**: 50 cr/t x 1.20 x 3.00 = **180 cr/t**

### **Example 2: Selling Machinery on a Rich Planet Under a Corporate Monopoly**
- **Base Price of Machinery**: 600 cr/t
- **Rich Planet Modifier** (Sale): +30%
- **Corporate Monopoly Modifier**: +25%
- **Final Price**: 600 cr/t x 1.30 x 1.25 = **975 cr/t**

## Smuggling and Black Market Prices

In cases of trade restrictions or sanctions, players may turn to the black market for illicit trading. Smuggling offers higher rewards but carries greater risks.

- **Smuggling Price Modifiers**: Black market goods can sell for **+150% to +300%** of the base price, depending on demand and the risk involved.
- **Risk of Detection**: Players must make Smuggling Checks to avoid detection. Failure could result in confiscation, fines, or imprisonment.

**Example**: A player smuggling weapons to a planet under a trade embargo could sell them for 200% of their base price, but failure in a Smuggling Check may result in losing everything.

## Hazards and Opportunities

1. Piracy and Smuggling:
    - Players can take risks for higher rewards by moving high-demand illegal items like weapons, drugs, or artifacts.
    - **Black Market Price Modifiers**: Illegal goods sold through black markets can fetch between 150% and 300% of the base price, depending on demand.
2. Economic Events
    - Galactic or planetary events can shift markets dramatically. These can be triggered by player actions, NPC factions, or random events.
    - **Economic Boom**: Trade surges, lowering prices by 25% but increasing demand.
    - **Resource Crisis**: A vital resource becomes scarce, spiking prices by up to 300%.
    - **Political Unrest**: Trade with rebellious planets may carry high risk but high reward.
3. Factional Influence: Corporations, governments, or pirate lords influence trade routes. Players may ally with or oppose them for various benefits or challenges.

## Trade Goods Revisited

New categories of goods can deepen the economy. Consider introducing **biotech**, **spices**, **starship components**, or **cultural artifacts** from lost civilizations.

| Goods          | Average Price | Supplier World  | Availability      |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Biotech        | 1,200 cr/kg   | Medical Planets | 1d20x20 kg       

 |
| Starship Parts | 3,000 cr/unit | Industrial      | 1d10x5 units      |
| Spices         | 150 cr/kg     | Agricultural    | 1d20x30 kg        |
| Alien Wildlife | 5,000 cr/ea   | Frontier        | 1d6 creatures     |
| Cultural Relics| 80,000 cr/ea  | Frontier        | 1d4 artifacts     |
